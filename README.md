# FlappyBird evolutional AI
This is one example of a flappyBird AI which trains it self to perfection and runs the game. The AI uses a small neural network consisting of four input node and one output node which if having the value above the threshhold says it is a good time to jump.

The most efective set of inpur attributes is as of what i found: the velocity of the bird, the y-position of the bird, the y-position of both the upcoming pipe gap and the y-position of the gape after that.

Above is a screenshot of the program showing the games progres and the state of the network nodes.
